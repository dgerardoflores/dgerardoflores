# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my README! If you're reading this, I'm guessing you're hear to learn a bit about me. So let's go!

### About Me

I am a lifelong programmer who loves to dive into new projects and ideas, and constantly advance both the developer and user experience. This drives me forward, either in my daily work on my company's product, improving the state of our internal tools and platform, or contributing a broad matrix for projects.

### Currently Working On

Right now my great focus is on web technologies, mobile devices and cloud computing, applying my knowledge to improve business processes, creating useful tools and community projects.

### Looking for Help?

Most of my contributions go to tools that everyone can use, but if you need my help for a project, what technologies can I help you with?
